We've a list of an integer like Array [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], and `K` = 3 (the items in our sub-items)

Find Sub items with maximum value, the items `couldn't` repeated number, and the order from the original Array of the item should keep.

E.g:
- Array[1,5,4,2,9,9,9]
- Sub items
```
[1,5,4]
[5,4,2]
[4,2,9]
```

=> Sub items is [4,2,9]
